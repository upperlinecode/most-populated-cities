# Most Populated Cities Quiz

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/most-populated-cities)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/most-populated-cities)

## The Goal

We have some pretty big and bustling cities here in the US. At over 8.5 million people, New York City is the most populated city in America. But that's not even half the population of the 10th most populated city in the world! Use your knowledge of HTML and Javascript to create a quiz that will test user's knowledge of the 10 most populated cities in the world and their population size. How many do you think you can guess?

## The Lab

Use HTML and JavaScript to accept input from users, and dynamically add content to the page if the user enters a correct city.
